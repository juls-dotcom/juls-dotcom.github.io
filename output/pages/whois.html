                    <h1>Whois</h1>
                    <p>My name is Julien. I am a data scientist currently working in Germany. I learned to program on my own during my PhD, 
mostly with MatLab at first but rapidly turned towards Python &amp; R. I have been working on data projects for more than 10
years now, both as team member &amp; leader.  </p>
<p>Currently, I work at a retail company, where I improve data-driven processes in general, and develop new tools to increase our
understanding of customer dynamics, using Machine Learning approaches, while trying to keep the hype of data science away
from projects, as long as not necessary. 
I am also a PMP certified project manager, and a SCRUM master. I am really interested in the topics of data management,
and in general techniques on how to better use and explain data work in companies.</p>
<p>In the past, I spent 10 years doing research in neuroscience, in particular in the field of social neuroscience, 
trying to understand human social behavior. As an academic data scientist, my worked involved heavy data management, 
from experiment planing, data collection, extraction, munging and modelling. </p>
<p>In 2019, tired of long hours in experimental rooms, I decided to turn the page of academia. Life is too long to have one
single career ;)</p>
<p>Hit me if you want to talk. I gave quite some talks in the past, in countries as far as Japan and Canada, so I am very 
happy to come and share my views on things, at a conference, or around a nice cold beer.</p>
