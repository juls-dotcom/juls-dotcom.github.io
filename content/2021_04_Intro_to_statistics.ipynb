You will run tests that are wrong, you will not respect assumptions, but at least, you will get increasingly familiar with the outputs and the parameters that one can play with.  Relatively fast, you will get familiar with the kind of tests you could or nor could not run on a given dataset, and feel more confident :)"

Why would they be particularly good and one test, and not others? One might want to look into the specifics of the tests, to try and pinpoint the actual processes camels are good at. In turn, you refine your `theory` and generate new `hypothesis`."

This last one I have rarely encountered in my work, but depending on your field, you might stumble upon it often.\n",

However, we cannot disentangle what caused what exactly. In order to so, we would have to design an experiment allowing for causal inference. \n",

Each designs will have advantages and inconvenients, and should be chosen carefully\n",

    "One might want to come up with a single value to summarize distributions, which can be useful to make comparisons or reporting. While `distribution spread` seems like an important feature, let's focus here on how to summarize distributions:\n",

    "* **Mode:** The mode is the value that occurs the most frequently in the distribution, so basically, the tallest bar.\n",
    "* **Median:** The median is the middle value in the distribution when values are ranked in order of magnitude. I like to use this computation when the distribution has a large spread, or more importantly when many outliers might be present. Median, contrary to mean, is more resistant to outliers.\n",

    "While `mode`, `median` and `mean` can be useful to quantify distributions, it might be useful to quantify as well the dispersion of distributions. This is very important, since two distributions might have the same `mean`, but very different spread. In turns this affects the conclusions you can make statistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there are several methods that one could use:\n",
    "* **Range:** take the largest value and subtract it from the smallest one. You can already see that, since it takes simply two value in the distribution into account, it is extremely affected by outliers in the data and might not be the right tool in most cases. You would probably have to complete the analysis with some measure on the distribution's shape (interquartile range, see below)\n",
    "* **Sum of Square:** the sum of square is probably the most widely (indirectly) used spread calculation. Before we get to its rationale, let's first talk about the `deviance`, which is the subtraction between each value in the distribution from the `mean` of the distribution. In mathematical terms: $dev = \\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})$ You can already how this can be problematic. Since the mean will automatically separate some value below and above, you will be adding values of opposite signs and cancel out important information in your data. As a result, people tend to square the deviations ( you could also remove the negative signs, from a mathematical point of view, but squaring is the standard method). This is known as the `Sum of Squared`: $SS = \\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2$\n",
    "* **Variance:** The problem with the `SS` is that it measures the total dispersion of the population, which we cannot use to compare across samples that differ in size. As a result, people tend to compute the `variance`, which follow the same logic as the `mean`, by diving the `SS` by the number of observations (minus 1, see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-sample-variance-is-divided-by-n-1-89821b83ef6) for an explanation related to `degrees of freedom`, which I won't be discussing here). As a result, the variance can be computed as follows: $Var = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N-1}$\n",
    "* **Standard Deviation**: Finally, the measure that can be used to make meaningful comparison between samples. As you can see from the SS method, we circumvent deviations of opposite signs, but that comes at a cost: our unit of explanation is squared (because we squared every error). To obtain a measure that is conceptually easier to grasp and compare, we can square root the `variance` to obtain the `standard deviation`: $SD = \\sqrt(\\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N-1})$"
