That allowed me, back in the days, to unify different statistical models that I learned separately and had troubles connecting as part of the same world"

    "As we saw before, (data) scientists test hypothesis to come up with a model of how a certain phenomenon works. Some models might be quite good at capturing the truth of the process, while others might not be so good at it. The degree to which a model reflects the data used for analysis is the `fit` of the model. As I discussed in [other posts](https://juls-dotcom.github.io/machine_learn_intro_2.html), the fit is not everything, and the model should be generalizable. But I am getting ahead of myself...Let's go back to the fit."
