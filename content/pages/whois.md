My name is Julien. I am a data scientist based in Germany at the moment. I started programing during my Masters,
which turned out to be quite useful for Work&Travel projects, as well as for getting my PhD in Neuroscience.
I have been working on data projects for more than 10 years now, both as team member & leader.  

Currently, I work at Orsay, a retail company where I implement data-driven marketing processes, and develop new tools to 
increase our understanding of customer dynamics. I use Machine Learning approaches when necessary, while trying to find 
a good balance between interpretability and accuracy, keeping the "hype" in data science as much at bay as possible.

I've realized that my research training is quite useful to approach business problems: most of the coding 
([Python](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncaKdl5IqaaYDdXAOPmLrDQtG2Oc0Dzv/view), 
[R](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1htJ_b9EK5yEX7A4oo1mDcN39TbRMi3eh/view), statistical skills (frequentist and 
[bayesian](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vj2zmOsy0d_Kc1S42uG5QQiSadAMcnGv/view)), and 
[Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncaKdl5IqaaYDdXAOPmLrDQtG2Oc0Dzv/view)
I learned in research is extremely relevant to address the different issues faced by data projects in business environments.
I'm quite happy about that, since I really enjoy the research process from literature scraping, sandbox testing & data collection 
to oral presentations and publications (although not peer-reviewed anymore!).
 
I am also a [PMP certified project manager](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PccDSxAxox2iBPsgLbSJ9anvDTnfxfuG/view), 
and a [SCRUM master](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gcRO2vAOpnM-bWklBMoA0Xa60JTGXkKb/view). 
I am really interested in topics of data management, and
focus strongly on articulating my projects in ways that are explainable and meaningful for non-tech stakeholders.

In the past, I spent 10 years doing research in neuroscience, in particular in the field of social neuroscience, 
trying to understand human social behavior. As an academic data scientist, my work involved heavy data management, 
from experiment planing, data collection, extraction, munging and modelling. 
In 2019, tired of long hours in experimental rooms, I decided to turn the page of academia. Life is too long to have one
single career ;)

Hit me if you want to talk. Presenting my data to all types of audience is something I am used to, at a conference, 
or around a nice cold beer. And I enjoy that really much, so don't hesitate to get in touch!
